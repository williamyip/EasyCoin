My attempt at a cryptocurrency implementation in less than 2000 lines of code

### Motivation
Cryptocurrencies and smart-contracts aren't the most trivial concepts to understand. Terms such as wallets, addresses, block proof-of-work, transactions and signatures make more senese when they are in a broad context. This project is my humble attempt at implementing a concise and simple implementation of cryptocurrency.

### What is a Cryptocurrency?
[According to Wikipedia,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency) A cryptocurrency is a binary data designed to work as a medium of exchange wherein individual coin ownership records are stored in a leedger existing in the form of a computerized database using strong cryptography to secure transaction records, to control the creation of additional coins, and to verify the transfer of coin ownership.
