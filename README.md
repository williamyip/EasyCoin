My attempt at a cryptocurrency implementation in less than 2000 lines of code

### Motivation
Cryptocurrencies and smart-contracts aren't the most trivial concepts to understand. Terms such as wallets, addresses, block proof-of-work, transactions and signatures make more senese when they are in a broad context. This project is my humble attempt at implementing a concise and simple implementation of cryptocurrency.

### What is a Cryptocurrency?
[According to Wikipedia,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency) A cryptocurrency is a binary data designed to work as a medium of exchange wherein individual coin ownership records are stored in a leedger existing in the form of a computerized database using strong cryptography to secure transaction records, to control the creation of additional coins, and to verify the transfer of coin ownership.

### What is a blockchain?
Taking a look at the [Bitcoin Organization wiki website](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Main_Page), a blockchain is a transaction database shared by all nodes participating in a system based on the Bitcoin protocol. A full copy of a currency's blockchain contains every transaction ever executed in the currency. With this information, one can find out how much value belonged to each address at any point in history. More details on [Bitcoin Paper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)
